I will show you how simple it is to use local contact tracing.

## The players

### The Care Center

Imagine you are the recptionist in the lobby of a care center.

You sit down, take out your tablet, and open your public room, the Lobby.

### Vendor

Next, a vender returns to the building. He uses his phone to check-in at the Lobby.

### Visitor

At the same time, a resident's family member arrives for their daily visit to Grandmother. They, too, check-in at the Lobby.

## The Process


### Visitors Warn Rooms

Later that day, the vendor gets his positive covid test results. Turns out he was an asymptomatic carrier. So he hits the Warn Room button and goes into quarantine.

### Rooms Respond to Warnings

You see an alert pop up on your screen: Someone may have infected your facility. The system automatically identifies Grandmother's visitor as someone in the lobby at the same time as the asymptomatic carrier.

### Rooms alert Visitors

That visitor, too, sees an alert appear on their phone that they may be harboring the virus. They, too, settle in for a two-week self-isolation period.

## The End

The virus is stopped dead in its tracks.
