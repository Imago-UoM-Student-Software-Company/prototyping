<p>This document stipulates the rationale and resolution of forces that make the essential Local Contact Tracing app.</p>
<h2 id="players">Players</h2>
<p>LCT consists in a set of <strong>public spaces</strong> called Rooms and a set of <strong>private individuals</strong> called Visitors and a multiset of Occupants. Data needs to discriminate these sets by name convention.</p>
<h3 id="rooms">Rooms</h3>
<p><strong>Room</strong> identity MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name the <strong>building</strong></li>
<li>Name the <strong>room</strong>, itself (a room name can be generic; e.g., &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;outside&quot;)</li>
<li>Be <strong>unique</strong> in the network (see Network Section below)</li>
<li>Be <strong>identifying</strong> names in the public domain (there is no presumption of privacy)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visitors">Visitors</h3>
<p><strong>Visitor</strong> identity MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be <strong>unique</strong> in the network</li>
<li>Use less than 20 characters</li>
<li>Cannot include a '.' character</li>
</ul>
<p>Visitor identity MAY be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>anonymous</li>
<li>pseudonymous</li>
<li>identifying</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-network">The Network</h2>
<p>The word network can refer to (tangible) infrastructure or (intangible) organization structure.</p>
<h3 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h3>
<p>In this design, <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> provides the network infrastructure. Each organization structure has a namespace. Names must be unique within this namespace. If an individual is active in more than one organization structure, they can use the same name in all namespaces.</p>
<h3 id="organization-structure">Organization Structure</h3>
<p>How private individuals interact in public determines organization structure.</p>
<h4 id="offices">Offices</h4>
<p>A common example of organization structure in the network is an office. Here, (the same) employees interact in generally accepted ways.</p>
<h4 id="businesses">Businesses</h4>
<p>Another common example of network organization structure are retailers. Here, a variety of private indivicuals will interact in novel ways.</p>
<h4 id="special-cases">Special Cases</h4>
<p>Care Centers exemplify an important category of network organization structure: the matrix. Here more than one Care Center may employ more than one private individual. When individuals are front-line care workers, the risk they pose to each other as they move through the network can be higher than in most other structures.</p>
<h4 id="geography">Geography</h4>
<p>Geographic limits provide the final category of network organization. For example, a small town can provide the organzition structure for a local contact tracing network. This network can admit any other structure.</p>
<h2 id="invariants">Invariants</h2>
<p>To work properly, LCT must comport closely with human behavior.</p>
<h3 id="room-conditions">Room Conditions</h3>
<p>For example, a Visitor MAY enter a Room, but first, the Room MUST be open physically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there can be no restrictions on processing a virus exposure alert. To alert past occupants, a Room MAY be closed.</p>
<h3 id="visitor-conditions">Visitor Conditions</h3>
<p>In this design, to see a virus exposure alert, a Visitors MUST be connected to the network.</p>
<p>The Visitor MAY be in a Room when the alert from another Room arrives. If a Visitor is not online the moment a Room raises the virus exposure alert to Visitors, the Room MUST notify the Visitor the next time the Visitor connects to the network.</p>
