<p>I will show you how simple it is to use local contact tracing.</p>

<h3 id="the-care-center">The Care Center</h3>
<p>Imagine you are the recptionist in the lobby of a care center.</p>
<p>You sit down, take out your tablet, and open your public room, the Lobby.</p>
<h3 id="vendor">Vendor</h3>
<p>Next, a vender returns to the building. He uses his phone to check-in at the Lobby.</p>
<h3 id="visitor">Visitor</h3>
<p>At the same time, a resident's family member arrives for their daily visit to Grandmother. They, too, check-in at the Lobby.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<h3 id="visitors-warn-rooms">Visitors Warn Rooms</h3>
<p>Later that day, the vendor gets his positive covid test results. Turns out he was an asymptomatic carrier. So he hits the Warn Room button and goes into quarantine.</p>
<h3 id="rooms-respond-to-warnings">Rooms Respond to Warnings</h3>
<p>You see an alert pop up on your screen: Someone may have infected your facility. The system automatically identifies Grandmother's visitor as someone in the lobby at the same time as the asymptomatic carrier.</p>
<h3 id="rooms-alert-visitors">Rooms alert Visitors</h3>
<p>That visitor, too, sees an alert appear on their phone that they may be harboring the virus. They, too, settle in for a two-week self-isolation period.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>The virus is stopped dead in its tracks.</p>
